A) Git and GitHub
What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.
It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 and is maintained by Junio Hamano.

Track code changes

Track contributors

Enable collaboration

Maintain different versions of a project

What Git Does

Manages projects using repositories

Creates local copies using clone

Tracks changes using staging and commits

Supports branching and merging

Pushes and pulls updates from remote repositories

What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git

It hosts source code repositories

Owned by Microsoft since 2018

Working with Git

Initialize a repository

Modify files

Stage changes

Commit changes

View history

Revert to previous versions

Git stores changes, not complete copies of files.

B) Docker Container Environment
What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that allows applications to run in isolated environments.

Advantages

Lightweight

Portable

Platform-independent

Consistent runtime environment

Docker can be configured using NVIDIA Docker or standard Docker.

C) Angular Application
Angular Application Features

User Registration

User Login

Profile Component to display user data

Components and Services

Conclusion

In this assignment, Git and GitHub were used for version control, Docker was used to create a containerized environment, and an Angular application was developed with user authentication and profile management features.
